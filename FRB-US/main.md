# FRB-US with VAR-based Expectations

You can follow the tutorial by reading this page and copying and pasting code
into your Julia REPL session. In this case, you will need the model file,
[`FRBUS_VAR.jl`](FRBUS_VAR.jl).

All the code contained here is also available in this file: [`main.jl`](main.jl).

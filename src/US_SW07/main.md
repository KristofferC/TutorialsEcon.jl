## Part 1: The model

### Load the model

The model is described in its own dedicated module, which in turn is contained
in its own file, `SW07.jl`. We can load the module with `using SW07`, then the
model itself is a global variable called `model` within that module.

```@repl sw07
using SW07
m = SW07.model
```

### Examine the model

This model is too big to fit all of its details in the REPL window, so only a
summary information is displayed. We can see the entire model with `fullprint`.

```@repl sw07
fullprint(m)
```

We can also examine individual components using the commands `parameters`,
`variables`, `shocks`, `equations`.

```@repl sw07
parameters(m)
```

### Setting the model parameters

We must not change any part of the model in the running Julia session except for
the model parameters and [steady state constraints](@ref
steady_state_constraints). If we want to add variables, shocks, or equations, we
must do so in the model module file and restart Julia to load the new model.

When it comes to the model parameters, we can access them by their names from
the model object using dot-notation.

```@repl sw07
m.crr # read a parameter value
m.cgy = 0.5187 # modify a parameter value
```

!!! note 
    In this model the values of the parameters have been set according to the
    [`replication data`](@ref replication_data).

### The model flags and options

In addition to model parameters, which are values that appear in the model
equations, the model object also holds two other sets of parameters, namely
flags and options.

Flags are (usually boolean) values which characterize the type of model this is.
For example a linear model should have its `linear` flag set to `true`.
Typically this is done in the model file before calling [`@initialize`](@ref).

```@repl sw07
m.flags
```

Options are values that adjust the operations of the algorithms. For example, we
have `tol` and `maxiter`, which set the desired accuracy and maximum number of
iterations for the iterative solvers. These can be adjusted as needed at any
time. Another useful option is `verbose`, which controls the verbosity.

Many functions in `StateSpaceEcon` have optional arguments by the same names as
the names of model options. When the argument is not explicitly given in the
function call, these functions will use the value from the model option of the
same name.

```@repl sw07
m.verbose = true
m.options
```

## Part 2: The Steady state solution

The steady state is a special solution of the dynamic system, one that remains
constant over time. It is important on its own, but also it can be useful in
several ways. One example is that linearizing the model requires a particular
solution about which to linearize and the steady state is the one typically used.

In addition to the steady state we also consider another kind of special
solution, which grows linearly in time. If we know that the steady state
solution is constant (i.e. its slope is zero), we can set the model flag
`ssZeroSlope` to `true`. This is not required, however in a large model it might
help the steady state solver converge faster to the solution.

The model object `m` stores information about the steady state. This includes
the steady state solution itself as well as a (possibly empty) set of additional
constraints that apply only to the steady state. This information can be
accessed via `m.sstate`.

```@repl sw07
m.sstate
```

### [Steady state constraints](@id steady_state_constraints)

Sometimes the steady state is not unique, and one can use steady state
constraints to specify the particular steady state one wants. Also, if the model
is non-linear, these constraints can be used to help the steady state solver
converge. Steady state constraints can be added with the [`@steadystate`](@ref)
macro. It can be as simple as giving a specific value or we can write an
equation with multiple variables. We're allowed to use model parameters in these
equations as well.

```@repl sw07
@steadystate m a = 5
m.sstate
```

We can clean up the constraints by emptying the constraints container.

```@repl sw07
empty!(m.sstate.constraints)
m.sstate
```

!!! note "Important note"
    Steady state constraints that are always valid can be pre-defined in the model file.
    In that case, all calls to the [`@steadystate`](@ref) macro must be made after calling
   [`@initialize`](@ref).

### Solve for the steady state

The steady state solution is stored within the model object. Before solving, we
have to specify an initial condition. If the model is linear, this makes no
difference, but in a non-linear model a good or a bad initial guess might be the
difference between success and failure of the steady state solver.

We can do this by calling [`clear_sstate!`](@ref). This call removes any
previously stored solution, sets the initial condition, and runs the pre-solve
pass of the steady state solver. The initial guess can be given with the `lvl`
and `slp` arguments; if not, an initial guess is chosen automatically.

Once that's done, we call [`sssolve!`](@ref) to find the steady state. This
function returns a `Vector{Float64}` containing the steady state solution, but
it also writes that solution into the model object. The vector is of length
`2*nvariables(m)` and contains the level and the slope for each variable.

```@repl sw07
clear_sstate!(m)
sssolve!(m);
```

If in doubt, we can use [`check_sstate`](@ref) to make sure the steady state solution
stored in the model object indeed satisfies the steady state system of equations.
This function returns the number of equations that are not satisfied.
A value of 0 is what we want to see. In verbose mode, the it also lists the
problematic equations and their residuals.

```@repl sw07
check_sstate(m)
```

### Examine the steady state

We can access the steady state solution via `m.sstate` using the dot notation.
```@repl sw07
m.sstate.dc
```

We can also assign new values, but we should be careful to make sure it remains
a valid steady state solution.
```@repl sw07
m.sstate.dc.slope = 0.001
check_sstate(m)
```

Okay, let's undo that.
```@repl sw07
m.sstate.dc.slope = 0
check_sstate(m)
```

We can examine the entire steady state solution with [`printsstate`](@ref).
```@repl sw07
printsstate(m)
```

# README

This project contains a list of tutorials demonstrating the use of StateSpaceEcon group of Julia packages.
Each tutorial is in its own subdirectory. They are meant to run in a Julia session running in the root
directory of the project, which is what happens in VSCode, not in the subdirectory of the specific tutorial.

## Installation

The tutorials are designed to run in the Julia environment in the root of the project. This environment
must be instantiated before it can be used. If unsure, open [installation.jl](installation.jl) and
run it in VSCode (Ctrl+F5).
